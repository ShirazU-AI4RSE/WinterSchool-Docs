  "summary": "The paper presents KNIME as a modular, visual workflow system supporting the full data analysis lifecycle from data ingestion to modeling and visualization. It defines explicit workflow stages, activities, inputs, outputs, and architectural components, illustrated through multiple diagrams and examples. The work also compares KNIME to other data-pipelining tools and discusses extensibility, scalability, and interoperability challenges."
