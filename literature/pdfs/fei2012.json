  "summary": "The paper proposes a formal, dataflow-based scientific workflow composition framework in which workflows are the sole operands for composition. It introduces fully composable workflow constructs with formal semantics, supports parallelism, provenance, and exception handling, and validates the approach through detailed examples. The framework is positioned as more expressive and mathematically elegant than existing scientific and business workflow models."
