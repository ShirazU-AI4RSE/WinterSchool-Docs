  "summary": "The paper presents WfCommons, a comprehensive framework supporting simulation-driven scientific workflow research through the collection, analysis, generation, and simulation of workflow instances. It defines clear workflow stages, inputs, outputs, and tools, supported by architectural and process diagrams. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that WfCommons produces more realistic synthetic workflows than prior approaches."
