**Host Institution**: Shiraz University

## Core workshop objective

To study and teach how Generative AI can support the explicit modeling of research and software lifecycles, from literature analysis and conceptual modeling to data collection and research software implementation, while maintaining traceability, quality control, and human oversight.
All hands-on artifacts and surveys are designed to be reused as empirical material for a research paper.
