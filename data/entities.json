The distribution is developed in Poland, and was first released in 2010. The distribution does not include a package manager, and uses JWM (Joe's Window Manager) as its default window manager. It also comes with Conky preinstalled. When installing programs with the distribution, the distribution will retrieve the Windows version rather than the Linux version due to it coming pre-installed with Wine (A compatibility layer for Windows applications), and not having any package manager. The distribution is geared towards people who prefer a lightweight distribution. There is a version of the distribution called the \"4MLinux Game Edition\" which provides 90s games natively such as Doom, and Hexen.",
